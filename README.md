# GundamDivJavaScirpt
Some JavaScript and CSS to generate RX-78-2 look Alike Div.

#How to use

1. Include relevant css and js file.
Example code:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/gundam.css"></link>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/gundamDivInit.js"></script>
#you might need to bind the script after the page is loaded.

2. Declare a Div you wish to have a gundam face on with class = 'gundam'.
Example code: 
<div class='gundam'>
</div>
  
3. The gundamDivInit.js code will take care of creating require Divs for the
gundam face.

4. Check out gundamExample.html for some pratical example.

5. Have fun.
